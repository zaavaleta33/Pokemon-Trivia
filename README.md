Userflow -> The user is presented with 3 options right at the start. Trivia game, Leaderboard, and Pokemon Generator.
If the user selects Trivia, the user is preseted with a screen that asks questions about pokemon. Once the user gets a question wrong from the list of 
option's the game is over. Once the game is over the user gets to see their resutls and can choose to go back to the homepage, or the leaderboard. If the 
user selects the leaderboard either from the results page or the homepage, they are presented with a list of names. Next to each name is the persons score 
that they got. If the user scored higher then for example number 1. Then they would be places as number one and the names right after go down a place.
Lastly, if the user selects the Pokemon Generator, the user just has to shake the phone and a randome pokemon would apear right in front of the user's
